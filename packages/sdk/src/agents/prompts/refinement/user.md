Perform backlog refinement for the following request:

## Task Information

**Title:** {{taskTitle}}

**Description:** {{taskDescription}}

**Priority:** {{taskPriority}}

{{externalContext}}

## Your Analysis

**IMPORTANT: All output must be in English, even if the input is in another language.**

Please provide a comprehensive refinement analysis covering:

1. **SUGGESTED TITLE** - Reformulate the title in clear, professional English. Use an action verb pattern like "Implement X", "Add Y", "Fix Z". Make it specific and actionable.

2. **REFORMULATED DESCRIPTION** - Write a detailed description in English. If the original description is empty or unclear, propose a comprehensive one based on the title and any available context. Include:
   - What the feature/change is about
   - Why it's needed (if known)
   - Any relevant context or constraints

3. **BUSINESS CONTEXT** - What problem does this solve? Why is it important?

4. **OBJECTIVES** - What are we trying to achieve? What are the measurable outcomes?

5. **QUESTIONS** - What needs clarification from the Product Owner? What assumptions need validation?

6. **SPLIT SUGGESTION** - Should this be broken down into smaller stories? (if complexity is L or XL)
   - For each proposed sub-story, identify dependencies (which sub-stories must be completed first)
   - For each proposed sub-story, draft specific acceptance criteria

7. **PRELIMINARY CRITERIA** - How will we validate success? What are the acceptance criteria?

8. **COMPLEXITY ESTIMATE** - XS/S/M/L/XL based on scope, uncertainty, and dependencies

Remember: Focus on business needs and clarity, not technical implementation details.
